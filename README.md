Welcome to this repository which contains the code of the web clients and the native iOS and Android apps of the Trillion Tree Campaign at https://www.trilliontreecampaign.org/ written with React-Native. For contributions please read our [contribution guide](https://github.com/Plant-for-the-Planet-org/treecounter-app/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md) as well as our [code of conduct](https://github.com/Plant-for-the-Planet-org/treecounter-app/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and the following information:

## Directory Structure

`ios` houses the iOS project files, `web` houses the web configuration, assets and index.html, and `android` contains Android project files.The `app` contains the react code base for all platform i.e components, reducers, containers etc.

`index.web.js` is the entry point of web platform build, `index.js` is the entry point of both iOS and android platform build process.

## Configuration

Copy `.env.develop.sample` to `.env.develop` and add the necessary API keys for your development environment.
Install nvm following instructions from https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script
Run `nvm install && nvm use` to install and use required version of node.

## Web Setup

Run following commands

```
bash
npm install
npm start
```

To run the app as prod, useful for testing features like (hashed js/css):

```
npm run start-prod-server
```

## iOS Setup

* Install xcode greater then 9.0.
* Run following commands
```
bash
brew install node
brew install watchman
npm install -g react-native-cli
npm install
cd ios && pod install
```

* Please use node v 12.14.1 LTS; App doesn't build with 13.0 + versions.

### Running into iOS simulator

Build and run the app in development mode deployed from Metro Bundler in an iOS simulator (starts Metro Bundler automatically if not already running, also starts iOS simulator):

```
bash
npm run ios
```

If you have problems with a cached version of the bundle, you can stop the Metro Bundler and manually start it with the reset cache option:

```
react-native start --reset-cache
```

## Android Setup

Steps for setting up Dev Env for android on MAC is as follows:

* Install Latest Android Studio.
* From Android studioâ€™s SDK Manager add SDK 23, 27 and Build tool Version 23.0.1
* Install JDK 8 if not already there and set JAVA_HOME specific to your JDK Version.
* Create .bash_profile if not already there and add following variables in it:

```
bash
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_191.jdk/Contents/Home
```

* Run following commands

```
bash
brew install node
brew install watchman
npm install -g react-native-cli
npm install
```

### Running into Android emulator

Build and run the app in development mode deployed from Metro Bundler (starts Metro Bundler automatically if not already running) on an emulator or device. You need to start an Android emulator or attach a device manually before:

```
bash
npm run android
```

If you have problems with a cached version of the bundle, you can stop the Metro Bundler and manually start it with the reset cache option:

```
react-native start --reset-cache
```

## Development process

This project uses GitFlow (https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) with Master-Branch `master` and Development-Branch `develop`. The Master-Branch will be automatically released by CircleCI to the production system. There are currently some more protected branches also build by CircleCI automatically and mapped to test backends using the branch name as subdomain.
